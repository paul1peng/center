# Center

[Link.](http://paul1peng.github.io/center/)

Invisible circles, each with a color, coming out from the center
of the drawing, evenly spaced. When a circle goes past the edge,
it comes back in from the other side. Draw a line between the centers
of overlapping circles colored the average of the circles' colors,
lighter when further apart, heavier when closer together.
